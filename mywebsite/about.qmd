## About Me

I'm Tianwei Shi, also called Sophie. This is my first time coming to the US pursuing my master degree and the academic success. 

I was born in Jiangsu and grew up in Shanghai. I achieved my Bachelor degree of Engineering in Shanghai University but didn't want to stop there. I am still confused with some most basic concepts in Data Science field, wondering how it is applied in the prestigious enterprise and the real-world to faciliate the good business decision or just make the world better. That's the reason why I came here.

Besides these study stuff, I'm also a deep lover of Anime and Japanese culture. I can speak a little Japanese and am quite familiar with the Japanese transportation system. I also love drawing and riding which can help me refresh my brain from high-pressure and heavy workload. 

Love Georgetown. Hoya Saxa!!
