Thursday and Friday are busy for two overlapping reasons: they are both business-travel return days and popular departure days for weekend trips. This combination pushes their flight volumes even higher than other weekdays. Sunday also ranks high because it is the main return-home day for weekend travelers.\nIf your route offers multiple daily flights, I will recommend flying on Saturday to avoid crowds effectively. However, if your destination has limited service, choosing a busier day may provide more flight options and reduce the risk of inconvenient schedules."

    "text": "3. Thanksgiving’s Unexpected Quiet Days\nIn 2018, Thanksgiving fell on November 22nd, and the time series chart shows a clear drop in flight activity around the holiday.\nIn the three days leading up to the 22nd, the average number of flights was close to 20,000, as most people chose to travel or go home before the holiday itself. Between the 23rd and 25th, however, the preceding 3-day average number fell to about 15,000, the lowest level of the entire month. Once the 26th arrived, the preceding 3-day average number of flight volume quickly climbed back to around 21,000 as most travelers returning home from 23rd to 25th.\n\n\nCode\npre_avg_num = pd.read_csv('../data/MiniProject_problem7_Tianwei_Shi_ts1553 .csv')\n\nfig = px.line(\n    pre_avg_num,\n    x=\"FlightDate\",\n    y=\"avg_total_flights\",\n    title=\"Average number of flights over the preceding 3 days\",\n    markers=True,\n    color_discrete_sequence=[\"#ff7f0e\"],\n)\n\nfig.update_traces(line=dict(width=3))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    height=500,\n    template=\"plotly_white\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Date\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Number of Flights (Preceding 3-Day)\",\n     margin=dict(l=60, r=60, t=100, b=120)\n\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nThis pattern suggests that the days just before and just after Thanksgiving are noticeably quieter at airports.

The cancellation map for November 2018 shows that weather-related disruptions were concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast.

The airports with the highest average departure delay for each airline are concentrated in the northeastern states and the Midwest.\nTherefore, to avoid these disruptions, it is wise to avoid these destinations during late November. Traveling to the West or Southwest generally offers a smoother experience, with fewer cancellations, fewer delays, and far less extreme weather. All of which contribute to a more reliable trip."

Airlines that Make Your Trip Smoother\nHowever, there are still some good airline suggestions that can help you avoid heavy delays and reduce the chance of cancellations.\nCombining this plot with the one above, I would recommend Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and PSA Airlines. These airlines show lower maximal departure delays and higher early-departure rankings. Their highest average departure-delay airports also have lower delay minutes compared with other carriers.
